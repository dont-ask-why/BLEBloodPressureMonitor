## Blood Pressure Monitor WiFi Interface - ESP35

This is the Arduino code for a ESP32 used to add BLE capability to a Panasonic blood presure monitor.

## Disclaimer

This is a very rough initial version of the code. Don't expect reliability. Also, keep in mind you're modifying a medical device and that CAN interfere with it's accuracy and reliability. Remeber that a WiFi device emits RF which can affect other devices. If you choose to modify it, don't use it as a medical device anymore. Use this code at your own risk. I cannot be held liable if, knock on wood, your house burns down our your dog dies!

## Changes by the fork

I HAVE NOT MADE ANY MODIFICATIONS YET. STAY TUNED FOR FUTURE CHANGES!

I build a small pulseoximeter w/ an app and thought: I could add a blood pressure monitor to that!
My connection uses BLE from an ESP32 so some changes will have to be made.
Luckily I found the same device online for (hopefully) very easy implementation.
